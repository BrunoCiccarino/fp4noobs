# Getting started

Learning haskell, besides being easy, is fun, but to really learn, like everything in the programming area, we have to practice, this first session will be the basic level ninja-01, then comes ninja-02 which will be the intermediate level , and then ninja-03 who will be the striker. At the end of each session you will have problems to practice yourself, we also added surprise exercises, so take the opportunity to practice a lot and everything will become much easier.
