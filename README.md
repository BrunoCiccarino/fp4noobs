The objective of this repository is above all to learn functional programming and pass on some of this learning to you. I think the best way to learn FP is to start with Scheme, which is a Lisp dialect, considered for a long time to be the simplest language in the world, so let's go in parts.

### What is Scheme?

Scheme is a minimalist dialect of Lisp (LISt Processing), designed in the 1970s by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman. Its primary goal was to provide a clean, small, and elegant subset of Lisp, emphasizing a functional programming paradigm while retaining Lisp’s core principles like symbolic computation and dynamic typing.

Scheme became popular in academia due to its simplicity and suitability for teaching programming concepts, particularly recursion, higher-order functions, and abstraction. It is a language defined by standards, such as the *Revised^n Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (RnRS)* and the *IEEE Scheme Standard*. This ensures consistency across its many implementations.

One of Scheme’s distinguishing features is its minimalistic core. Unlike many programming languages that are bloated with features, Scheme keeps its base small, allowing programmers to build more complex abstractions themselves. This philosophy helps in learning fundamental programming concepts without being overwhelmed by the language's syntax or structure.

Scheme also supports:

- **First-class functions:** Functions are treated as values, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures.
- **Tail-call optimization:** Efficiently handles recursive calls, making recursion practical for many tasks where iteration might be used in other languages.
- **Macros:** Powerful tools for creating domain-specific languages and transforming code at compile time.
- **Homoiconicity:** Code and data share the same structure, allowing for powerful metaprogramming techniques.

Scheme serves as a foundational language for understanding functional programming concepts and the underlying principles of computation. Its simplicity allows learners to focus on problem-solving, while its expressiveness provides a gateway to mastering more complex languages and paradigms.
